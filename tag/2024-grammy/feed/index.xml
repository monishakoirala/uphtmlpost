										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Recording Academy has officially revealed nominations for the 2024 GRAMMYs, which will take place Sunday, Feb. 4, at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The 2024 GRAMMYs, officially known as the 66th GRAMMY Awards, will air live (8:00-11:30 PM, LIVE ET/5:00-8:30 PM, LIVE PT) on the CBS Television Network and will stream on Paramount+ (live and on demand for Paramount+ with SHOWTIME subscribers, or on demand for Paramount+ Essential subscribers the day after the special airs)^.</p>
<p>Three new GRAMMY categories will debut at the 2024 GRAMMYs: Best African Music Performance, Best Alternative Jazz Album and Best Pop Dance Recording.</p>
<p>These history-making category additions are part of a larger set of updates and amendments, which go into effect immediately at the 2024 GRAMMYs, aimed at making the GRAMMY Awards process &#8220;more fair, transparent and accurate&#8221;, according to Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr.</p>
<p>The GRAMMYs voting process begins with members and record companies submitting entries, which are then screened for eligibility and category placement. The Online Entry Process (OEP) Access Period took place from July 17, 2023 – Aug. 31, 2023. First Round Voting occurred from Oct. 11 to Oct. 20, 2023. Lastly, Final Round Voting will span Dec. 14, 2023 to Jan. 4, 2024 — and the winners will be announced during Music&#8217;s Biggest Night on Feb. 4!</p>
<p>The Academy&#8217;s voting members, all involved in the creative and technical processes of recording, then participate in (1) the nominating process that determines the five finalists in each category; and (2) the final voting process which determines the GRAMMY winners.<br />
